This is a simple practice in crawler, which is **only for study and communication**. It should never be used for illegal or improper ways like cheating in the exam. If so, the one who did it is responsible for his own behavior instead of the author. The author strongly suggest that every student should follow the rules and the school should fix the bugs as sooner as possible!
